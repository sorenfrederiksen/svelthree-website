question: I'm new to Svelte and theee.js, where should I start?
---

For questions regarding Svelte or three.js usage / APIs please visit their official websites:

- [https://svelte.dev/](https://svelte.dev/)
- [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)

It's hard to say where to start best ü§î because ideally using svelthree requires a certain amount of experience with both Svelte and three.js. Svelthree aims to offer an API close to the one of three.js for Svelte-developers, so it seems more logical to start with Svelte / svelthree and get more familiar with the three.js-API if you need to break out and take a deeper dive into it in order to achieve your project's goal.

‚òùÔ∏è Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need Svelte or svelthree to create highly performant three.js UX, all you really need is knowledge of JavaScript and three.js.
