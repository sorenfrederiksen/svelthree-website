question: I'm new to Svelte and three.js, where should I start?
---

For questions regarding Svelte or three.js usage / APIs please visit their official websites:

- [https://svelte.dev/](https://svelte.dev/)
- [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)

Svelthree aims to offer an API close to the one of three.js for Svelte-developers, so it seems more logical to start with Svelte. A certain amount of experience with both Svelte and three.js would be best.

☝️ Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need Svelte or svelthree to create highly performant three.js UX, all you REALLY need is knowledge of JavaScript and three.js.
